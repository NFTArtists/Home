<h1>Mannequins?</h1>
<p>
Here we have 1000, unique, each with their own imperfections and colourway Mannequins, Artist Mannequins. The things artists have always used as tools. Tools to help them create and make and design, tools to help an artist.
Thats what we have here. Each Mannequin is a tool a tool for you. To work for you. 
</p>

<p>
When you get a Mannequin you get a space, here on the website where you are always displayed. Someone comes along be it another mannequin or someone looking for art or an artist or a project or a creator a person looking, comes along, and sees 1000 Mannequins all together and clicks one. That one is you they then see your work and your profiles, because it links directly to you. Then on your profiles your twitter profile for example, display your mannequin and it drives more people here, back to you, back to your peers. 
</p>
